# Weather App using React and Redux

Weather App project from [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

This project gave me a lot more experience creating views composed of React components, using Redux to manage app state and dispatch actions, and also integrated some cool APIs including [Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org/forecast5) and Google Maps using [React-Google-Maps](https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps).
